This update moves the integration away from snapshot and milestone dependencies and onto the final releases of both Shiro 1.2.0 and Lift 2.4. 

In addition to this, the published JARs no longer sit on scala-tools.org, but rather they live on oss.sonatype.org. Please update your SBT resolver configuration to:

<pre><code>
  libraryDependencies += "eu.getintheloop" %% "lift-shiro" % "0.0.5"
  
  resolvers ++= Seq(
    "apache.repo" at "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/"
    "sonatype.repo" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/public/"
  )
  
</code></pre>
