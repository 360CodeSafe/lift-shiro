Lift Shiro
==========

This is an integration between [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/) and the [Lift Web framework](http://liftweb.net/). Specifically this integration does not use Shiro's built in web.xml resource filters to control access to URLs... it instead uses Lift's sitemap Locs. In addition it also has a range of snippets for conditionally displaying content based on rules and permissions.
